// This is slightly more difficult version of the famous FizzBuzz 
// problem which is sometimes given as a first problem for job 
// interviews. (See also: FizzBuzz Code.) Consider the series 
// of numbers beginning at start and running up to but not 
// including end, so for example start=1 and end=5 gives the 
// series 1, 2, 3, 4. Return a new String[] array containing
// the string form of these numbers, except for multiples of 3, 
// use "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5 use "Buzz", 
// and for multiples of both 3 and 5 use "FizzBuzz". In Java,
// String.valueOf(xxx) will make the String form of an int or other type.
// This version is a little more complicated than the usual version 
// since you have to allocate and index into an array instead of just
// printing, and we vary the start/end instead of just always doing 1..100.
